# DevOps Learning - BASH

## 🧠 CoderCo DevOps Guide: BASH Scripting

Welcome to my **Bash Scripting Arena**!  
This repository contains a total of **15 Bash Battle Arena scripts** plus **4 core assignment scripts**, completed as part of the **CoderCo DevOps Bash Module**.  

Throughout these exercises, I learned how to automate system tasks, handle files, work with conditionals, and manage monitoring and backups, which all are  essential skills in DevOps scripting.
